This notebook builds upon the first study by applying advanced text modeling techniques.  
It includes:
- Deep Learning approaches such as LSTM or Transformer-based architectures
- Embedding representations (Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT embeddings)
- Comparative evaluation between traditional ML and LLM-based models
- Analysis of contextual sentiment and fine-tuning for accuracy improvements

This case study highlights the evolution from classical NLP to LLM-driven sentiment modeling.

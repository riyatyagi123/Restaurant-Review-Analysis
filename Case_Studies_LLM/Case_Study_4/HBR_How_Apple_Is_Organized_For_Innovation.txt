WELL KNOWN FOR ITS 
innovations in hardware, software, 
and ser v ices. Thanks to them, it grew from some 8,000  
employees and $7
 
billion in revenue in 1997, the year Steve  
Jobs returned, to 137,000 employees and $260
 
billion in 
revenue in 2019. Much less well known are the organizational  

design and the assoc iated leadership model that have played  

a c ruc ial role in the company ™s innovation success.
When Jobs arrived back at Apple, it had a conventional  
struc ture for a company of its size and scope. It was divided  

into business units, each w ith its own P&L responsibilities. 

G eneral managers ran the Mac intosh products group, the 

information appliances div ision, and the ser ver products  

div ision, among others. As is often the c ase w ith decentral
-

ized business units, managers were inclined to ˜ght w ith 

one another, over transfer prices in partic ular. B elieving that  

conventional management had sti˚ed innovation, Jobs, in  

his ˜rst year returning as CEO, laid o˛ the general managers  

of all the business units (in a single day), put the entire com
-

pany under one P&L, and combined the disparate func tional  

departments of the business units into one func tional organi
-

zation. (S ee the exhibit ﬁApple™s Func tional Organization.ﬂ)
The adoption of a func tional str uc ture may have been 
un
 
surprisin
g for a company of Apple™s size at the time. What 
is
 
surprisingŠin f ac t, remarkableŠis that Apple retains it today,  

even though the company is nearly 40 times as large in terms  

of revenue and f ar more complex than it was in 1998. S enior  

v ice presidents are in charge of func tions, not produc ts. As 

was the c ase w ith Jo b s  before him, CEO Tim C o o k  o c c u p i e s  the  

only position on the organizational chart where the design,  

engineering, operations, marketing, and retail of any of Apple™s  

main products meet. In e˛ect, besides the CEO, the company  

operates w ith no conventional general managers: people 

who control an entire process from product development  

through sales and are judged according to a P&L statement.
Business histor y and organizational theor y make the c ase  
that as entrepreneurial ˜rms grow large and complex, they  

must
 
shift f rom a functional to a multidiv isional str uc ture to  
align accountability and control and prevent the congestion  

that occ urs when countless dec isions ˚ow up the org chart  

to the ver y top. Giv ing business unit leaders full control over  

key func tions allows them to do what is best to meet the  

needs of their indiv idual units™ c ustomers and maximize  

their results, and it enables the exec utives overseeing them  

to assess their performance. As the Har vard Business School  

historian Alf red Chandler doc umented, U.S. companies such 

as DuPont and G eneral Motors moved f rom a functional to  

a multidiv isional str uc ture in the early 20th century. By the  

latter half of the century the vast majority of large corpora
-

tions had followed suit. Apple proves that this conventional  

approach is not necessar y and that the func tional struc ture  

may bene˜t companies f ac ing tremendous technologic al  

change and industry upheaval.
Apple™s commitment to a func tional organization does  
not mean that its str uc ture has remained static. As the  

importance of arti˜c ial intelligence and other new areas has  

increased, that struc ture has changed. Here we disc uss the  

innovation bene˜ts and leadership challenges of Apple™s  

distinc tive and ever- evolving organizational model, which  

may be useful for indiv iduals and companies wanting to 

better understand how to succeed in rapidly changing  

environments.
THE CHALLENGE
Major companies 

competing in many 

industries stru˛le to stay 

abreast of rapidly 
 
changing technologies.
ONE MA JOR CAUSE
They are typically organized into business 

units, each with its own set of functions. 
 

Thus the key decision makersŠthe unit 

leadersŠlack a deep understanding of all 
 
the domains that answer to them.
THE APPLE MODEL
The company is organized around 

functions, and exper tise aligns with 

decision rights. Leaders are cross-

functionally collaborative and deeply 

knowledgeable about details.

WHY A FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION?
Apple™s main purpose is to c reate produc ts that enrich  
people™s daily lives. That involves not only developing 

entirely new produc t c ategories such as the iPhone and the  

Apple Watch, but also continually innovating w ithin those  

c ategories. Perhaps no produc t feature better re˚ec ts Apple™s 

commitment to continuous innovation than the iPhone c am

era. When the iPhone was introduced, in 2007, Steve Jobs  

devoted only six seconds to its c amera in the annual keynote  

event for unveiling new produc ts. Since then iPhone c amera  

technolog y has contributed to the photography industr y 

w ith a stream of innovations: High dynamic range imaging  

(2010), panorama photos (2012), Tr ue Tone ˚ash (2013), opti
-

c al image stabilization (2015), the dual-lens c amera (2016),  

portrait mode (2016), portrait lighting (2017 ), and night mode  

(2019) are but a few of the improvements.
To create such innovations, Apple relies on a str uc ture  
that centers on func tional expertise. Its fundamental belief  

is that those w ith the most expertise and experience in a  

domain should have dec ision rights for that domain. This  

is based on two v iews: First, Apple competes in markets 

where the rates of technologic al change and disruption are  

high, so it must rely on the judgment and intuition of people  

w ith deep knowledge of the technologies responsible for  

disr uption. L ong before it c an get market feedback and solid  

market forec asts, the company must make bets about which  

technologies and designs are likely to succeed in smart
-
phones, computers, and so on. Rely ing on technic al experts  

rather than general managers inc reases the odds that those  

bets w ill pay o˛.
S econd, Apple™s commitment to o˛er the best possible  
produc ts would be underc ut if short-term pro˜t and cost

targets were the overriding c riteria for judging investments  
and leaders. Signi˜cantly, the bonuses of senior R&D exec
-

utives are based on company w ide performance numbers  

rather than the costs of or revenue f rom particular produc ts. 

Thus product dec isions are somewhat insulated from short-

term ˜nanc ial pressures. The ˜nance team is not involved in  

the produc t road map meetings of engineering teams, and 

engineering teams are not involved in pric ing dec isions.
We don™t mean to suggest that Apple doesn™t consider  
costs and revenue goals when deciding which technologies  

and features the company w ill pursue. It does, but in ways  

that di˛er from those employed by conventionally organized  

companies. Instead of using overall cost and price targets as  

˜xed parameters w ithin which to make design and engineer
-

ing choices, R&D leaders are expec ted to weigh the bene˜ts  

to users of those choices against cost considerations.
In a functional organization, indiv idual and team repu
-
tations ac t as a control mechanism in plac ing bets. A c ase in  

point is the dec ision to introduce the dual-lens c amera w ith  

portrait mode in the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016. It was a big wager  

that the c amera™s impac t on users would be su˝ciently great  

to justif y its signi˜c ant cost.
One exec utive told us that Paul Hubel, a senior leader  
who played a central role in the portrait mode e˛ort, was  

ﬁout over his skis,ﬂ meaning that he and his team were taking 

a big risk: If users were unw illing to pay a premium for a  

phone w ith a more costly and better c amera, the team would 

most likely have less c redibility the next time it proposed an  

expensive upgrade or feature. The c amera turned out to be a  

de˜ning feature for the iPhone 7 Plus, and its success further  

enhanced the reputations of Hubel and his team.
It™s easier to get the balance right between an attention to  
costs and the value added to the user experience when the 

leaders making decisions are those w ith deep expertise in  
their areas rather than general managers being held account
-
able primarily for meeting numeric al targets. Whereas the  

fundamental princ iple of a conventional business unit struc
-

ture is to align accountability and control, the fundamental  

principle of a func tional organization is to align expertise and  

dec ision rights.
Thus the link between how Apple is organized and  
the type of innovations it produces is clear. As Chandler  

f amously argued, ﬁstr ucture follows strateg y ﬂŠeven though  

Apple doesn™t use the struc ture that he antic ipated large  

multinationals would adopt.
Now let™s turn to the leadership model underly ing Apple™s 
struc ture.
THREE LEADERSHIP CHARACTERISTICS
Ever since Steve Jobs implemented the func tional organi
-

zation, Apple™s managers at ever y level, from senior v ice  

president on down, have been expected to possess three key  

leadership charac teristic s: deep expertise that allows them 

to meaning fully engage in all the work being done w ithin  

their individual func tions; immersion in the details of those  

func tions; and a w illingness to collaboratively debate other  

func tions during collective decision-making. When manag

ers have these attri

es, dec isions are made in a coordinated  
f ashion by the people most quali˜ed to make them.
D e ep exp er tis e.
 Apple is not a company where general  
managers oversee managers; rather, it is a company where  

experts lead experts. The assumption is that it™s easier to  

train an expert to manage well than to train a manager to be  

an expert. At Apple, hardware experts manage hardware,  

software experts software, and so on. (D ev iations f rom  

this principle are rare.) This approach c asc ades down all

Apple™s Functional Organization
In 1997, when Steve Jobs returned to Apple, it had a conventional structure for its size and scope. It was divided into business units, each with  
its own P&L responsibilities. After retaking the helm, Jobs put the entire company under one P&L and combined the disparate depar tments of  

the business units into one functional organization that aligns exper tise with decision rightsŠ a structure Apple retains to this day.

specialization. Apple™s leaders believe that world-class talent  
wants to work for and w ith other world- class talent in a 

specialty. It™s like joining a sports team where you get to learn 

f rom and play w ith the best.
E arly on, Steve Jobs c ame to embrace the idea that  
managers at Apple should be experts in their area of man
-

agement. In a 1984 inter v iew he said, ﬁWe went through that  

stage in Apple where we went out and thought, 
Oh , we ™ re  

gonna b e a big company, let™s hire profe ssional manage ment. 

We went out and hired a bunch of professional management.  

It didn™t work at all....They knew how to manage, but they  

didn™t know how to 
do
 any thing. If you™re a great person, why  

do you want to work for somebody you c an™t learn any thing  

f rom? And you know what™s interesting? You know who the 

best managers are? They are the great indiv idual contributors  

who never, ever want to be a manager but dec ide they have  

to be–bec ause no one else is going to–do as good a job.ﬂ
One c urrent example is Roger Rosner, who heads 
Apple™s software application business, which includes 

work-produc tiv ity apps such as Pages (word processing ), 

Numbers (spreadsheets), and Keynote (presentations) along  

w ith GarageB and (music composition), iMov ie (mov ie 

editing ), and News (an app prov iding news content). Rosner,  

who studied elec tric al engineering at Carnegie Mellon, joined  

Apple in 2001 as a senior engineering manager and rose to  

become the direc tor of iWork applic ations, the vice president  

of produc tivity apps, and since 2013 the VP of applic ations.  

With his deep expertise gained f rom prev ious experience  

as the director of engineering at several smaller software  

companies, Rosner exempli˜es an expert leading experts.
In a functional organization, experts leading experts  
means that spec ialists c reate a deep bench in a given area,  

where they can learn f rom one another. For example, Apple™s  

more than 600 experts on camera hardware technology  

work in a group led by Graham Townsend, a c amera expert.  

B ec ause iPhones, iPads, laptops, and desktop computers all  

include c ameras, these experts would be sc attered across  

produc t lines if Apple were organized in business units. That  

would dilute their collec tive expertise, reduc ing their power  

to solve problems and generate and re˜ne innovations.
Immersion in the det ails.
 One principle that permeates  
Apple is ﬁL eaders should know the details of their orga
-

nization three levels down,ﬂ bec ause that is essential for  
speedy and e˛ec tive cross-
 
func
tional dec ision-making at the  
highest levels. If managers attend a dec ision-making meeting 

w ithout the details at their disposal, the dec ision must either  

be made w ithout the details or postponed. Managers tell war  

stories about making presentations to senior leaders who  

drill down into cells on a spreadsheet, lines of code, or a test  

result on a produc t.
Of course, the leaders of many companies insist that they  
and their teams are steeped in the details. But few organi
-

zations match Apple. Consider how its senior leaders pay  

extreme attention to the exac t shape of produc ts™ rounded  

corners. The standard method for rounding corners is to  
 
use an arc of a c ircle to connec t the perpendic ular sides of  

a rec tangular objec t, which produces a somewhat abr upt  

transition from straight to c ur ve. In contrast, Apple™s leaders  

insist on continuous c urves, resulting in a shape known  

in the design community as a ﬁsquircleﬂ: The slope starts  

sooner but is less abr upt. (S ee the exhibit ﬁOne Example  

of Apple™s Attention to D etail.ﬂ) An advantage of hardware  

produc ts w ithout abr upt changes in c urvature is that they  

produce softer highlights (that is, little to no jump in light  

re˚ec tion along the corner). The di˛erence is subtle, and  

exec uting on it isn™t simply a matter of a more complic ated 

mathematic al formula. It demands that Apple™s operations  

leaders commit to extremely prec ise manuf acturing toler
-

ances to produce millions of iPhones and other produc ts w ith  

squircles. This deep immersion in detail isn™t just a concern 

that is pushed down to lower-level people; it is central at the  

leadership level.
Hav ing leaders who are experts in their areas and can  
go deep into the details has profound implic ations for how  

Apple is r un. L eaders c an push, probe, and ﬁsmellﬂ an issue. 

They know which details are important and where to foc us 

their attention. Many people at Apple see it as liberating, 

even exhilarating, to work for experts, who prov ide better  

guidance and mentoring than a general manager would.  

Together, all c an strive to do the best work of their lives in  

their chosen area.
Willingnes s to c ollab oratively deb ate.
 Apple has  
hundreds of spec ialist teams ac ross the company, dozens of

40 spec ialist teams: silicon design, c amera software, reliabil
-
ity engineering, motion sensor hardware, v ideo engineering,  
core motion, and c amera sensor design, to name just a few.  

How on earth does Apple develop and ship produc ts that  

require such coordination? The answer is collaborative  

debate. B ec ause no func tion is responsible for a produc t or a  

serv ice on its own, c ross-functional collaboration is c ruc ial.
When debates reach an impasse, as some inev itably do,  
higher-level managers weigh in as tiebreakers, including at  

times the CEO and the senior VPs. To do this at speed w ith  

su˝cient attention to detail is challenging for even the best 

of leaders, making it all the more important that the company  

˜ll many senior positions f rom w ithin the ranks of its VPs,  

who have experience in Apple™s way of operating.
However, given Apple™s size and scope, even the exec utive  
team can resolve only a limited number of stalemates. The 

many horizontal dependencies mean that ine˛ec tive peer  

relationships at the VP and direc tor levels have the potential  

to undermine not only partic ular proj
 
ec
ts but the entire 
company. Consequently, for people to attain and remain in 

a leadership position w ithin a func tion, they must be highly  

e˛ective collaborators.
That doesn™t mean people c an™t express their points of  
v iew. L eaders are expec ted to hold strong, well-grounded  

v iews and advoc ate forcefully for them, yet also be w illing  
 
to change their minds when presented w ith ev idence 

that others™ v iews are better. D oing so is not always 

easy, of course. A leader ™s ability to be both partisan and 

open-minded is fac ilitated by two things: deep understand
-

i ng o f  a n d devotion to the company ™s values and common 

purpose, a nd  a  commitment to separating how 
r ight
 from 

how 
hard
 a particular path is so that the di˝c ulty of exec ut
-
ing a dec ision doesn™t prevent its being selected.
The development of the iPhone™s portrait mode illustrates  
a f anatic al attention to detail at the leadership level, intense  

collaborative debate among teams, and the power of a shared 

purpose to shape and ultimately resolve debates. In 2009  

Hubel had the idea of developing an iPhone feature that  

would allow people to take portrait photos w ith

a Japanese term that refers to the pleasing blurring of a  

backgroundŠwhich photography experts generally consider 

to be of the highest quality. At that time only expensive  

single-lens re˚ex c ameras could take such photos, but  

Hubel thought that w ith a dual-lens design and advanced

computational-
 
photograph
y techniques, Apple could add  
the c apability in the iPhone. His idea aligned well w ith the  
c amera team™s stated purpose: ﬁMore people taking better  

images more of the time.ﬂ
As the team worked to turn this idea into reality, several  
challenges emerged. The ˜rst attempts produced some  

amazing portrait pictures but also a number of ﬁf ailure c asesﬂ  

in which the algorithm was unable to distinguish between  

the central objec t in sharp relief (a f ace, for instance) and the  

background being blurred. For example, if a person™s face  

was to be photographed f rom behind chicken w ire, it was not  

possible to construc t an algorithm that would capture the  

chicken w ire to the side of the f ace with the same sharpness 

as the chicken w ire in front of it. The w ire to the side would 

be as blurred as the background.
One might say, ﬁWho c ares about the chicken w ire c ase? 
That™s exceedingly rare.ﬂ But for the team, sidestepping rare or  

extreme situationsŠwhat engineers call 
corne r case s
Šwo u ld  

v iolate Apple™s strict engineering standard of zero ﬁartifac ts,ﬂ 

meaning ﬁany undesired or unintended alteration in data  

introduced in a digital process by an involved technique and/or  

technolog y.ﬂ Corner c ases sparked ﬁmany tough disc ussionsﬂ  

between the c amera team and other teams involved, rec alls  

My r a  H a g ge r t y, the VP of s e n s o r  so f t w a r e  and UX prototyping,  

who oversaw the ˜rmware and algorithm teams. S ebastien  

Marineau-Mes, the VP to whom the c amera software team  

ultimately reported, decided to defer the release of the feature 

until the follow ing year to give the team time to better address  

f ailure c asesŠﬁa hard pill to swallow,ﬂ Hubel admits.
To get some agreement on quality standards, the engi
-
neering teams inv ited senior design and marketing leaders to  

meet, ˜guring that they would o˛er a new perspective. The  

design leaders brought an additional artistic sensibility to the  

debate, asking, ﬁWhat makes a beautiful portrait?ﬂ To help  

reassess the zero -artif ac ts standard, they collected images 

f rom great portrait photographers. They noted, among other  

things, that these photos often had blurring at the edges of a  

f ace but sharpness on the eyes. S o they charged the algorithm  

teams w ith achiev ing the same e˛ect. When the teams suc
-

ceeded, they knew they had an acceptable standard.
Another issue that emerged was the ability to prev iew a  
portrait photo w ith a blurred background. The c amera team  

had designed the feature so that users could see its e˛ect on  
their photos only 
af te r
 they had been taken, but the human  
interf ace (HI) design team pushed back, insisting that users  

should be able to see a ﬁlive prev iew ﬂ and get some guidance  

about how to make adjustments 
b efore
 taking the photo.  

Johnnie Manzari, a member of the HI team, gave the c amera  

team a demo. ﬁWhen we saw the demo, we realized that this  

is what we needed to do,ﬂ Townsend told us. The members  

of his c amera hardware team weren™t sure they could do  

it, but di˝culty was not an acceptable exc use for f ailing to  

deliver what would clearly be a superior user experience. After  

months of engineering e˛ort, a key stakeholder, the video  

engineering team (responsible for the low-level software that  

controls sensor and c amera operations) found a way, and the  

collaboration paid o˛. Portrait mode was central to Apple™s  

marketing of the iPhone 7 Plus. It proved a major reason for  

users™ choosing to buy and delighting in the use of the phone.
As this example shows, Apple™s collaborative debate  
involves people from various func tions who disagree, push 

back, promote or reject ideas, and build on one another™s 

ideas to come up w ith the best solutions. It requires open-
 
mindedness fr
om senior leaders. It also requires those 
leaders to inspire, prod, or in˚uence colleagues in other  
 
areas to contribute toward achiev ing their goals.
While Townsend is accountable for how great the c amera  
is, he needed dozens of other teamsŠ each of which had a 

long list of its own commitmentsŠto contribute their time and 

e˛ort to the portrait mode proj
 
ec t. A
t Apple that™s known as  
accountabilit y without control:
 You™re accountable for making  

the proj
 
ec t succeed ev
en though you don™t control all the other 
teams. This process c an be messy yet produce great results. 

ﬁG ood messﬂ happens when various teams work w ith a shared  

purpose, as in the c ase of the portrait mode proj
 
ec t. ﬁB
ad  
messﬂ occ urs when teams push their own agendas ahead of  

common goals. Those who become associated w ith bad mess  

and don™t or c an™t change their behav ior are removed f rom 

leadership positions, if not f rom Apple altogether.
LEADERSHIP AT SCALE
Apple™s way of organizing has led to tremendous innovation  

and success over the past two dec ades. Yet it has not been  

w ithout challenges, especially w ith revenues and head count  

hav ing exploded since 2008.
One Example of Apple™s At tention to D et ail
T he standard method for rounding the corners of a rectangular object is to use an 
 
arc of a circle to connect the object™s perpendicular sides. T hat can result in an abrupt 

transition in cur vature. To produce softer highlights by minimizing light re˜ection, 

Apple uses a ﬁsquircle,ﬂ which creates continuous cur ves.

As the company has grown, entering new markets and  
moving into new technologies, its func tional str ucture and 
leadership model have had to evolve. D eciding how to orga
-
nize areas of expertise to best enable collaboration and rapid  
decision-
 
making has been an important responsibility of the  
CEO. The adjustments Tim Cook has implemented in recent  
years include div iding the hardware func tion into hardware  
engineering and hardware technologies; adding arti˜c ial 
intelligence and machine learning as a func tional area; and  
moving human interf ace out of software to merge it w ith  
industrial design, c reating an integrated design func tion.
Another challenge posed by organizational growth is the  
pressure it imposes on the several hundred VPs and direc tors  
below the exec utive team. If Apple were to c ap the size or  
scope of a senior leader™s organization to limit the number  
and breadth of details that the leader is expec ted to own, the  
company would need to hugely expand the number of senior  
leaders, making the kind of collaboration that has worked so

func tional ac tiv ity. In 2006, the year before the iPhone™s  
launch, the company had some 17,000 employees; by 2019  
that number had grown more than eightfold, to 137,000.  
Meanwhile, the number of VPs approximately doubled, f rom 
50 to 96. The inev itable result is that senior leaders head  
larger and more diverse teams of experts, meaning more  
details to oversee and new areas of responsibility that fall  
outside their core expertise.
In response, many Apple managers over the past ˜ve years  
or so have been evolv ing the leadership approach described  
above: experts leading experts, immersion in the details,  
and collaborative debate. We have codi˜ed these adaptions  
in what we call the 
disc retionary leadership 
model, which  
we have incorporated into a new educational program for  
Apple™s VPs and directors
.
 Its purpose is to address the chal
-
lenge of getting this leadership approach to drive innovation  
in all areas of the company, not just produc t development,  
 
at an ever-greater sc ale.
When Apple was smaller, it may have been reasonable to  
expect leaders to be experts on and immersed in the details  
of pretty much every thing going on in their organizations. 
However, they now need to exerc ise greater disc retion 
regarding where and how they spend their time and e˛orts. 
They must dec ide which activ ities demand their full atten
-
tion to detail bec ause those ac tiv ities c reate the most value  
for Apple. Some of those w ill fall w ithin their existing core  
expertise (what they still need to 
ow n
), and some w ill require  
them to 
lear n
 new areas of expertise. Ac tiv ities that require  
less attention f rom the leader c an be pushed down to others  
(and the leaders w ill either 
teach
 others or 
dele gate
 in c ases  
where they aren™t experts).
Rosner, the VP of applic ations, prov ides a good example. 
Like many other Apple managers, he has had to contend  
w ith three challenges arising from Apple™s tremendous  
growth. First, the 
size
 of his func tion has exploded over the  
past dec ade in terms of both head count (f rom 150 to about  
1,000) and the number of proj
 
ec ts under way at any given 
time. Clearly, he cannot dive into all the details of all those  
proj
 
ec ts. S econd, the 
scop e
 of his portfolio has widened:  
Over the past 10 years he has assumed responsibility for new  
applic ations, including News, Clips (v ideo editing ), B ooks,  
and Final Cut P ro (advanced v ideo editing). Although apps  
are his core area of expertise, some aspects of theseŠamong  
them editorial content for News, how book publishing works,  
and video editingŠinvolve matters in which Rosner is not  
an expert. Finally, as Apple™s product portfolio and number  
of proj
 
ec ts have expanded, even more coordination w ith  
other functions is required, inc reasing the

collaborating ac ross the many units. For instance, whereas  
Rosner is responsible for the engineering side of News, other  
managers oversee the operating system on which it depends,  
the content, and the business relationships w ith content  
c reators (such as the 
Ne w York Time s
) and advertisers.
To cope, Rosner has adapted his role. As an expert who 
leads other experts, he had been immersed in detailsŠ
 
especially those concerning the top-level aspec ts of software  
applic ations and their architec ture that a˛ect how users  
engage w ith the software. He also collaborated w ith manag

ec ts that involved those areas.
But w ith the expansion of his responsibilities, he has  
moved some things f rom his

tions according to Apple™s norms. B eing a teacher doesn™t  
mean that Rosner gives instr uc tion at a whiteboard; rather,  
he o˛ers strong, often passionate c ritiques of his team™s  
work. (Clearly, general managers without his core expertise  
would ˜nd it di˝c ult to teach what they don™t know.)
The second challenge for Rosner involved the addition  
of ac tiv ities beyond his original expertise. Six years ago he  
was given responsibility for the engineering and design of  
News. Consequently, he had to learn about publishing news  
content v ia an appŠto understand news public ations, digital  
advertising, machine learning to personalize news content,  
architec ting for privac y, and how to incentivize publishers.  
Thus some of his work fell into the

agers f ace a steep learning c urve to acquire new skills. Given  
how demanding this is, only c ritic al new ac tivities should fall  
into this categor y. Over six years of intense learning, Rosner 
has mastered some of these areas, which are now in his  
owning box.
As long as a particular activ ity remains in the learning  
box, leaders must adopt a beginner ™s mindset, questioning  
subordinates in a way that suggests they don™t already know 
the answer ( bec ause they don™t). This di˛ers starkly from  
the way leaders question subordinates about ac tivities in the  
owning and teaching boxes.
Finally, Rosner has delegated some areasŠincluding  
iMovie and GarageB and, in which he is not an expertŠto  
people w ith the requisite capabilities. For ac tiv ities in the

able: the stu˛ of general management.
Whereas Apple™s VPs spend most of their time in the own
-
ing and learning boxes, general managers at other companies  
tend to spend most of their time in the delegating box. Rosner  
estimates that he spends about 40% of his time on activ ities  
he owns (including collaboration w ith others in a given area),  
about 30% on learning, about 15% on teaching, and about 15% 
on delegating. These numbers vary by manager, of course,  
depending on their business and the needs at a given time.
The disc retionar y leadership model preserves the funda
-
mental princ iple of an e˛ec tive func tional organization at  
sc aleŠaligning expertise and dec ision rights. Apple can  
e˛ectively move into new areas when leaders like Rosner 
take on new responsibilities outside their original expertise,  
and teams c an grow in size when leaders teach others their  
c raft and delegate work. We believe that Apple w ill continue  
to innovate and prosper by being organized this way.
APPLE™S FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION 
is rare, if not unique,  
among very large companies. It ˚ies in the f ace of prevailing  
management theor y that companies should be reorganized  
into div isions and business units as they become large. But  
something v ital gets lost in a shift to business units: the  
alignment of dec ision rights w ith expertise.
Why do companies so often cling to hav ing general man
-
agers in charge of business units? One reason, we believe,  
is that making the change is di˝c ult. It entails overcoming  
inertia, realloc ating power among managers, changing an  
indiv idual-
 

oriented incentive system, and learning new ways  
of collaborating. That is daunting when a company already  
f aces huge external challenges. An intermediate step may be 
to c ultivate the experts-leading- experts model even w ithin  
a business unit str uc ture. For example, when ˜lling the next  
senior management role, pick someone w ith deep expertise  
in that area as opposed to someone who might make the best  
general manager. But a full-˚edged transformation requires  
that leaders also transition to a func tional organization.  
Apple™s track rec
 
ord proves that the rewards may justify the  
risks. Its approach c an produce extraordinary results.
